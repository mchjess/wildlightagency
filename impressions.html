            <i>Impressions</i> invites viewers to slow down and really see the quiet, intricate natural patterning
            of the urban Braidwood landscape. Rendered in conté and charcoal on large-format paper, these true-to-life field
            studies of local trees on Duncan Street and Ryrie Street draw on surrealist frottage traditions, reimagined by artist
            Jessica Lee. This exhibition celebrates gentle, attentive looking and allows the mind to wander while the eyes rest.

          <h2>Why make this work?</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            <!-- (Optional 200–300 words. Keep it calm and practical—why frottage, why trees, why scale, why slow looking.) -->
          </p>
          <p>
        This work is part of a larger practice-led art process exploring <i>slowing down</i> to <i>really look</i> in order to see our personal, everyday worlds more clearly. It offers viewers intricate frottage renderings in true-to-life scale of a Silver Birch on Ryrie Street and a London Plane Tree on Duncan Street in Braidwood, NSW.
<p>
The natural patterning of bark and trees has always fascinated me. In Braidwood, I’m spoiled for choice. The region has a vast range of imported and native specimens that offer endless inspiration through their changing colours, rhythms, textures and movement.
<p>
I have made hundreds of renderings of lots of different trees as part of this project. The two presented for <i>Impressions</i> were selected not through comparison or analysis, but through a gradual, intuitive attachment that formed early in the process. Informed by surrealist approaches to automatism, the work intentionally follows instinctive and emotional responses — allowing unexplainable affinities to guide decision-making rather than being resolved through theory.
<p>
The physical act of working for this project is slow and immersive. Paper is wrapped directly around each tree and secured with elastic bandages, while charcoal, conté and pastel are drawn across the surface, tracing every ridge, fissure and irregularity encountered. The process is meditative, tactile and quietly absorbing, shaped by hours of sustained contact with each form. 
<p>
It is my hope that this sense of attentive pleasure carries through to the viewer, inviting a similar slowing of pace and perception for them too.

Sovereignty was never ceded. This land was stolen on January 26th 1788. She pays her respects to the Indigenous peoples past, present and emerging, acknowledges the wisdom of their elders and promises to care for country as best she can, wherever she is, for her own sake as much as for posterity's. Because she's a sensible woman who understands that her life relies on the environment she lives in and looking after country just makes bloody good sense after all.</small>
